<h1>Majority Element<h1>

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 

<strong>Example 1:</strong>

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3


<strong>Example 1:</strong>

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
 

<strong>Constraints:</strong>

<ul>
<li>n == nums.length</li>
<li>1 <= n <= 5 * 104</li>
<li>-109 <= nums[i] <= 109</li>
</ul>
